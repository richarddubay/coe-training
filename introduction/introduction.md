# Introduction

This is first day of school kind of stuff.

## Expectations

Let‚Äôs set some expectations up front:

- No use of in-IDE AI assistants. You know that old saying about how when you write something down you remember it better? That‚Äôs what we want for y‚Äôall. We want you to type it out so that you will better remember it, have a little bit of muscle memory, and so that you will learn how a certain thing works and understand why it works the way it does. It‚Äôs forced regression. Like when you have to throttle your browser to see what happens to your site when you‚Äôre on a 3G network. Obviously feel free to use them when you‚Äôre doing your regular work, but please turn them off when you‚Äôre working on the class stuff.
- That being said, if you get stuck, and need some help or if you need something explained to you so that you‚Äôll understand it, things like ChatGPT and other AI tools are fine to use. We just don‚Äôt want you to have everything done for you, if that makes sense.
- At some point, either from the beginning or when we get to actions, we will be using Github. This project should probably live in your personal Github account for now.
- We‚Äôll be using TypeScript throughout this project.
- Ask questions. We‚Äôre going to go slow since y‚Äôall won‚Äôt have a ton of time to devote to this. So let‚Äôs async as many questions as we can in Slack to try to save us the time during the times we meet. That said, I think we can still spend the first 15-30 minutes answering questions and reviewing what we‚Äôve done so far, and the last half on new things.
- Speaking of questions, you‚Äôre going to ask me questions that I don‚Äôt know the answers to. That‚Äôs okay. I think pairing and figuring them out together will make us all better.
- I don‚Äôt expect you to get the homework done (yes ‚Ä¶ there will be homework üòâ ) for every possible thing we‚Äôre working on. You might decide that your project needs 13 tables, which means you‚Äôll need 13 models/controllers/views, etc. I totally don‚Äôt expect you to get all of them done before we meet again. Do as many as you can, for sure, but don‚Äôt kill yourself trying to get them all done. One example to show that you understand what‚Äôs happening is probably enough.
- I will be asking you to share your screen and talk through what you did or explain a thing.
- Remember, what I‚Äôm going to be showing you is _one way_ to build a full-stack application. There are many other ways. But I do believe giving you this foundation will help you understand what‚Äôs happening when you do get to use those other frameworks or methods. For example, knowing how to use Express to build out an API, and the way that we use models, views, and controllers, will help you jump into a Rails backend and be able to notice patterns and how things are set up even if you don‚Äôt actually understand the code there. Consider this your cheat sheet to every other project ever.

## Microsoft Article

[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design)

- We‚Äôre going to be creating a REST API.
- The idea of _request_ and _response_ is just like a fast food joint. You go up to the counter (or I guess now we open up our app) and we say we want ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like a bacon double cheeseburger with curly fries and a Sprite‚Äù (because I don‚Äôt drink caffeine), we pay our money (think of that as you being authorized to make that request), and in return the person behind the counter (or the delivery driver if you‚Äôre Door Dash-ing it) gives you your order. It‚Äôs the same thing in your API. You make a request by hitting a URL with certain information in it. We might attach some other data to it (like some authorization data to prove that we are allowed to make this request), and then the service returns to us the data we requested ‚Ä¶ usually in JSON format.
- Do not use `create-order` or `update-customer`. All your APIs should reference the entity (or thing) you‚Äôre working with. You‚Äôll often see multiples of the same url in an API. For example, you might see `https://url.com/orders` is being used for getting data on all the orders or for creating an order. The difference is in the HTTP verb. Which we‚Äôll get to soon.
- Never go more than 3 levels deep in your URL structure. Like it says here, `collection/item/collection` is far enough. If you have to go deeper, you can create another call to get the next `collection/item/collection` or you can also pass data on the query string. The query string method is preferred when it comes to things like search or pagination, that way where you are the data you‚Äôre getting can be constant through browser refreshes.
- You don‚Äôt necessarily need an API route for each of your tables. For example, if you have a `customers` table, and a `orders` table, but also have a many-to-many type `customerOrders` table, you probably don‚Äôt need to expose the `customerOrders` table to the API. Anything needed from that table can be retrieved by either the `customers` or `orders` endpoints.
- GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE. I won‚Äôt say you _won‚Äôt_, but you‚Äôll hardly ever use PATCH. Go through the differences between these.
- Most of the APIs you run across (and the ones that we‚Äôre going to create) will use the `application/json` MIME type.
- Pay attention to the status codes they tell you to return in this article. I had no idea on a lot of the endpoints I‚Äôve written about which status code to return. This handles that for me.
- Versioning: URI versioning means that you end up having more than one copy of each endpoint, whereas with query string versioning, that doesn‚Äôt have to happen. But with query string versioning, things could get pretty complicated if each resource has to handle different processing for different versions. URI versioning is what I ended up doing on the API I wrote for Highlands.

## Your Course Project

We first need to decide what project we‚Äôre going to work on. It literally doesn‚Äôt matter to me what you end up doing. When I took the course, I worked on a F1 Fantasy League app. Erin and Amy worked on a training app (like for people who are taking this training and the trainers) and a surveys app (think like every time Kathleen sends out a quarterly survey, for example), respectively. Would love this to be something that would benefit Unosquare and that would potentially be used by everyone but it doesn‚Äôt have to be.

## Homework

- Read the articles or watch the videos in the `Basics` and `Server Basics` section of the doc.
- Start thinking about what project you‚Äôd like to build.
