# 2. Only DC and Marvel

Date: 2025-03-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We have very limited storage space.

## Decision

We have agreed that, for now, we will only sell DC and Marvel comic books.

## Consequences

This means that we will potentially have less customers (and therefore less sales) in the beginning, but as our business grows, we can expand the warehouse and bring in other publishers.
