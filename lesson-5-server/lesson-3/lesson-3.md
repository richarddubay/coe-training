## Review / Questions

Letâ€™s go over the homework from last time:

## Swag

We're going to use a package called Swagger JS Doc [https://github.com/Surnet/swagger-jsdoc](https://github.com/Surnet/swagger-jsdoc) to create our API documentation from our routes. Here's a link to the documentation site if you need it: [https://swagger.io/docs/](https://swagger.io/docs/).

We'll also need a package called `swagger-ui-express` [https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-express).

Swagger used the OpenAPI specification

There's a command that we can run that will generate all of our swagger documentation for us.

**NEXT TOPIC (For Lesson 4)**: Express JS Middleware
Functions that you can set to run before all or certain controllers
